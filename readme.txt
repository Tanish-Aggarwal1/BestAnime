Hi, myself Tanish Aggarwal (991760172)
This is my assignment 4 for web programming - Software Development and networking engineering.

This paclage makes use of 3 npm packages
    -     "anime-package-assignment4": "^2.0.0"
    -     "waifu.it": "^1.2.1"
    -     "anime-wallpaper": "^3.2.1"

The first package is made by me.
It has a js object that contains information about the best anime of the years from 1975 to 2023 and when called returns a object containg Anime title, it's rating and a link to it's image.

the second package returns random facts about anime.

the third package is a failsafe if the link in my object doesn't work then it looks for a link to a new wallpaper image.
